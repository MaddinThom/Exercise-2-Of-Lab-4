# Exercise-2-Of-Lab-4

For the observer pattern, at the beginning of the level and end (when the player interacts with the door to end the level), the project plays an audio source of a man saying "Woo!" to celebrate the player playing this level. My approach was an audio source for when the player wins the level. This was done by creating an Audio Source component for the character, and grabbing it in the MovePlayer script. Then, when collision between the character and the door (tagged "Door" to get the object) occurs, the game plays the audio source.

For the singleton pattern, I attempted to use it to create a text that appears at the top to say whether the player is on the ground or not, as health or other variables would not really work for my assignment. I created a script to act as the text object, called GroundText, which has similar functions and variables in it as ScoreText example but based around whether the player is grounded. If they are then it says "Grounded", if not it says "Not Grounded". In the script for moving the player, in the Update function, the script reads GroundedText.Instance.IfGrounded() to call an instance of GroundedText and call the function that creates a Text of the grounded value.
